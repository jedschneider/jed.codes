In the first rendition of this site, I have enabled two services for form
submission.

I've been very excited to try some of the ideas the JAM stack supports. Along
with current projects and side ideas, hopefully this becomes a place to share
some of that journey. Please checkout the [colophon](/colophon) for a current
description of process and workflow.

## Contact Form

For the initial release of this site I am using [formspree](formspree.io) for
the contact form. This form is fully hosted and is rather limited in
functionality.

## Email Newsletter Subscribe Form

For the newsletter form we are going to try to submit data directly to their web
service Check out the [subscribe](/subscribe) page to check it out.
